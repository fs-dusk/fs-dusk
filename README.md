Fawn S. Dusk

six things:
- almost everything a developer should not be
- london, airstrip one
- trans, she/her
- violently pseudonymed, that is not a real name
- nearly passable knowledge of C#, JS, Python, and learning many more
- uncontrollable deep-seated rage towards poor user interface design
